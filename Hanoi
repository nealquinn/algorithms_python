"""
The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas's Tower and sometimes pluralized) 
Ã­s a mathematical game or puzzle.

It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, 
which can slide onto any rod. 
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, 
the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1.Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2.Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack
3.No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk
